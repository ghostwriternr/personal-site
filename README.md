# My personal site, 2017

Started as a quick way to force myself to learn React :dizzy: :dizzy: :dizzy:, I had a lot of fun creating this and learnt a hell lot of things about React. It is still a very simple site (with a not-quite-responsive design), but it does the job for now. 

Also, officially joining the React masterrace now!! We had a good run Angular :broken_heart:, but I'm not even sorry it had to end.

Have a look at the new site at https://ghostwriternr.me/
