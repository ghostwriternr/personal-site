Gliding over the ocean.  
Swimming in stardust.  
A stroll in the rain.  
A drive alone at dusk.  
A cold touch under the humid sun.  
A warm embrace over a freezing lake.  
The rooftop in summer clothes on a windy day.  
The comfort within someone's arms on a scary night.  
Running through a field.  
Counting stars that bleed.  
Interlocked fingers.  
Intertwined souls.  
Happiness.  
Right now.
