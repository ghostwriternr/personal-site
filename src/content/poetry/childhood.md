I close my eyes today, heavy breaths and bliss
as the cold wind marries my skin to the rain.
Back to the days you fled the English class
for your coffee spoon pleasure of winding
through the windmill farm screaming 'independence'.
There have been fires in the village,
but only time burnt you into black and grey smoke.

Innocence died; You survived.

Blind to the horrors of society
and drunk on the promises of love,
you woke up to adulthood callow.
And you melted into me without warning.
Lust, greed and hunger.
Skin, mint and bread I beg.
But all I hear today is the wailing
of the stars, mountains and rivers.
