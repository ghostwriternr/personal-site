I stumbled upon a river tonight -  
Crooked yet calm, and flowing  
amidst the rhythm of the night.  
I lay witnessing its pristine beauty,  
that intimate wish to remain a secret,  
and a long forgotten peculiar clarity.  
It is devoid of sparkles from the  
mid-monsoon sunshine or crickets  
that are still hopping too far away.  
I dip in my hands to its only warmth  
to find and feel the origin if I could  
or be perfectly still and led astray.  
I stumbled upon a river tonight -  
Crooked yet calm, and flowing  
amidst the rhythm of the night.  
Do I follow its bifurcations to my  
pink pillow case or just cherish its  
presence and rise wiser into the light.
