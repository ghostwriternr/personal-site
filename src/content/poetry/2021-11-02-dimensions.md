In my experiments with existence, I wander, sneak or hobble,  
Off to unperceivable dimensions that promise to never end.  
I like to plot across a space deep within and beyond my head,  
with all my perpendicular hands, my many mirages across time.  
And I do, as I do, see little change beyond new rifts once in a while, and maybe cry,  
While you see, or no longer do, a different me. And ask, who are you?  
From a higher dimension, I expand, into your world while Iâ€™m still fun,  
And do visible things like laugh, pinch and be beautiful with you.  
Before I slowly begin to wear the invisible parts for eyes to see,  
And realise I have condensed back to a place where I have never existed to you.  
Perhaps parallel existences offer some hope in these perceivable dimensions,  
Not via universes, but in shared memories of the past and newer dreams for the future.  
I can co-exist, beyond my unadorned three dimensions, in the dearest minds I adore.  
But tonight, I'm convinced, just isn't that time. Tonight, I'm nowhere beyond my own.
