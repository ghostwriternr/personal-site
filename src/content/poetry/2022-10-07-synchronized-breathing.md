I ask my heart to beat with you, and
my chest, my breath, my every shiver.
Let loose lying so close to you, they
catch up, slow down, no longer defer.
Months have passed, lingering seconds,
as you jump, and I laugh, until we rest.
In our little apartment, then cities apart,
the synchronized rise & fall of our chest.
Inconspicuous, innocuous, intrepid, I try,
to hide & stay within these rhythms of you.
You catch me, you ask me why I imitate,
maybe its all a ruse to never part from you.
