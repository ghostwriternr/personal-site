The light
Hidden beneath you
Swallow me whole
Hide my eyes
But let me see you

Tears and dark
Screams and joy
Between your crevices
You've seen it all
You've heard it all

Under my shoes
Over these years
I jump You twitch
An invisible noise
I hear you smile

How old are you
In years I know
But tell me instead
In forgotten faces
The hearts aglow

Let me count them
Fingerprints and kisses
I seek answers you know
I know you know
Teach me my wishes

Still counting the days
Before I leave Away from you
Please let me see
The light
Hidden beneath you
