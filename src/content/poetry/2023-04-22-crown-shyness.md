As summer draws near, the trees stand tall,
Their branches reaching for the sky in a call.
But the old man came with words of dread,
Of measures announced, to keep us led.
No picnics, no games, no holding of hands,
A world of restriction where freedom disbands.

We walk with care, in straight lines at the park,
A world that's changed and light grows dark.
We lie down and look up, staying far apart,
Find respite under the trees, listen to the heart.
The Crown Shyness dances in the breeze,
Mystical, magical, always a moment to seize.

Yet the shyness, today, feels not of the trees,
But a growing reflection of our own unease.
The world we live in, confusing and unkind,
seeks to control, to rule all and to bind.
So here we lie, refusing to let go of the light,
In our place of wonder, and a source of might.
