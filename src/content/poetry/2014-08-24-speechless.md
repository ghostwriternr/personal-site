She left a poem inside him
every time they kissed.
He loved every breath, for her
words were beyond beautiful.
He helped uncover emotions
she never knew existed.
They made up pretty well for their
lack of a voice to express each other.
They were probably just two
speechless souls to the world.
But the world didn't matter,
for they created one for their own.
