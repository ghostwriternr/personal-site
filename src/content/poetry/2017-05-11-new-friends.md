Walking through the forest falling,
I spotted you in the light of the early morning moon.
Red of cherries and green of monsoon.

You threw shade and I, words.
I wanted nothing of you, than to see you transform -
the pink to my springs.
Clever, fun and laughs.

Walking through the forest falling,
I spotted an orchard I wouldn't change.
I wouldn't ruffle.
Just let me stick around for a while.
Autumn passed and spring is here.
But we must get through the monsoons;
Let's do it together.
