                Welcome to my tiny space on the internet ðŸ«‚
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                I'm an optimistic software engineer with a love for writing
                poetry, curating music, reading fiction, and making origami. I
                occasionally make pixel art, and dream about a world with
                unbound access to information.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                I tend to value people above all else, both in my personal
                relationships and at work. I've always found this natural, and
                able to build systems around this simple truth.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                I'm currently spending a lot of time thinking about AI & agents,
                and converting some of those ideas into code at Cloudflare.
                Here's a quick overview of what I've been up to the last few
                years.
