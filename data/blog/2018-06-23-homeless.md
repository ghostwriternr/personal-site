But what do you do  
When it's the middle of the night  
When the lights are whizzing past  
And your vision starts to blur  
What do you do  
When you realize  
The dearest have shut their windows  
And the rest have simply disappeared  
What do you do  
In a city you once called home  
Is this how it feels  
To be home and still be homeless
