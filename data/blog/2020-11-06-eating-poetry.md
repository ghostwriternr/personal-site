Lord, I'm glutted, with humanity.

Unsatisfied, with the memoirs of war,  
broodings, of a teenager lost, letters to  
prisons and gardens and all religions,  
to a daughter, now and years in the future,  
a parent, a muse, a post office nowhere.

Words of love, laughter, longing and lies,  
of Dahlias, decisions, deaths and delight.  
My lord, I devour poetry every night.

I've tasted their joys and worldly hope,  
for crickets in dawn and raindrops alike,  
their cries to fight and bellows to unite,  
with rhymes of power and proclamation,  
to constructed crumbles they call a nation.

Forgive me, I've sinned, I never find. A poem  
to fill my appetite. I'm lost, afraid & seek  
a light. A poem for me, that says I'm alright.
