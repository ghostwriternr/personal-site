Across the hundred bridges, mate  
Views a thousand you cross  
Across the million steps, my mate  
You trudge o'er ferns and moss.  
Then hey! Some whiskey and wine  
Ya drink, to a trip you forever longed;  
If then you remembered me, my mate  
You know I'm smiling into the beyond.

**Author's note**: This was an impromptou piece that I wrote when a friend of mine pinged me while he was travelling with a different group of friends and requested a quick poem for the moment.
