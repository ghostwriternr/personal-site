The light  
Hidden beneath you  
Swallow me whole  
Hide my eyes  
But let me see you  

Tears and dark  
Screams and joy  
Between your crevices  
You've seen it all  
You've heard it all  

Under my shoes  
Over these years  
I jump You twitch  
An invisible noise  
I hear you smile  

How old are you  
In years I know  
But tell me instead  
In forgotten faces  
The hearts aglow  

Let me count them  
Fingerprints and kisses  
I seek answers you know  
I know you know  
Teach me my wishes  

Still counting the days  
Before I leave Away from you  
Please let me see  
The light  
Hidden beneath you
