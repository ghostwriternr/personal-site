She left a poem inside him  
every time they kissed.  
He loved every breath, for her   
words were beyond beautiful.  
He helped uncover emotions   
she never knew existed.   
They made up pretty well for their  
lack of a voice to express each other.  
They were probably just two   
speechless souls to the world.   
But the world didn't matter,   
for they created one for their own.
