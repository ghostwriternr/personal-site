TheGirlBehindThoseGlasses  
She was right in front of me,  
Sitting enveloped like a letter  
Relishing her moments -  
drowned in words.  
And like any pursed secret,  
I wanted nothing more  
Than to reveal her treasures -  
Her words and her memories.  
So ever so slowly,  
I worked through her waxed seal  
And climbed inside her language  
And onto her stage.  
I parted her straggly hair,  
Like the pleated curtain shadowing the magician.  
I parted her straggly hair,  
To be faced by a black edged frost.  
And so I started wiping the mist away,  
With my little pink thumb;  
Careful not to nudge her though  
From the grasps of poetry.  
I wanted to share her beauty  
With the rest of the universe, see?  
To take her by the hand  
And out into nothingness.  
To drift away from the pale blue dot  
We call home and wave!  
To cavort on the outskirts of Hi'iaka,  
And swing on the rings of Saturn.  
So I picked the litany of lights  
Glowing within her eyes,  
And across the bridge of her nose  
One by one with the tips of my rosebud fingers.  
And then,  
I drew them back into the sky  
As stars  
for all the world to see.  
I still know very very little  
about TheGirlBehindThoseGlasses.  
Too soon, she waved us goodbye,  
to slumber the dreamy night away.  
But I looked at these stars still shining,  
from my little corner of the world.  
Hoping someday,  
sometime,  
she'll stretch her arms,  
take my hand,  
and show me her galaxies.
