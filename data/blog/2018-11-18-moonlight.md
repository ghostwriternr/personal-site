To laughter and dazzling smiles,  
I adjust as daylight tardily arrives.  
Poster dreams in acrylic does it bring,  
To the towers and restless hearts.  
Blue, red, green be bright birds that sing  
Alive in this city that no one departs.  
But is it so bad, oh you lost little kite  
I like walking alone here in the moonlight.  

Shiny billboards and neon are the lights  
Casting happy feet as the night ignites.  
Music, poetry, painting and dance  
Colour the still river a majestic Blue.  
Drifting with the clock into a trance  
Enchanted by this all - the people and you.  
But is it still so bad, my shadow this twilight  
I like walking alone, here in the moonlight.
