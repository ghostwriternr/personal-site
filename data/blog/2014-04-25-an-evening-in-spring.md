Even this small twig,  
nearly sunk into the mud  
on this wet and beautiful evening in spring  
with just a delicate push,  
could convince me to write...  


Marooned by thoughts,  
slowly and peacefully,  
drifting through memories...  
Ones that hover in my palace,  
all over the horizon  
more beautiful than this sun upfront  
ready to go for it's daily dip...  


These pages  
ready to hold all my emotions,  
and all the ruthless scribbling ahead.  
Brushing over the very thought  
that they would be seeing  
my broadest grins, and  
the days I'd be standing  
in a mirror house without a light...  


And even if I'm unable  
to decide what to write now,  
brushing away all the dust   
and dandelions,  
my thoughts zip back  
to the wet grass under my feet.  
These mere strokes will be stuck  
in my mind, forever...  
just like my immature love for  
_**honey.**_
