A little more dust on the tables  
A little less laughter on the roadsides  
A little more silence at the library  
A little less photographs at the helipad  

Not a lot has changed since we left our home  
The stars will find new eyes gazing from rooftops  
Gardens will take comfort under warmer bodies  
Restaurants will get used to the chaos again  
2.2 will find a thousand more stories to listen to  
KGP always spins around the same cogwheels  

But  

Its our flustering hearts still drenched with promises  
Our hands still stretching out for the familiar touch  
Our eyes still watering over 'final sem' photographs  
Our skin still holding on to the long parting hugs  
KGP grows richer, deeper and heavier with memories  

Memories that we leave behind at home  
Dreaming of the new ones now awaiting  

Goodbyes are hard and final  
Today is not when I say goodbye  
To these people  
Or to KGP  
Today  
I reminisce our best moments  
And shout "Aloha!"  

\- With love, to the batch of 2018 :heart:
