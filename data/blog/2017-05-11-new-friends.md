Walking through the forest falling,  
I spotted you in the light of the early morning moon.  
Red of cherries and green of monsoon.

You threw shade and I, words.  
I wanted nothing of you, than to see you transform -  
the pink to my springs.  
Clever, fun and laughs.

Walking through the forest falling,  
I spotted an orchard I wouldn't change.  
I wouldn't ruffle.  
Just let me stick around for a while.  
Autumn passed and spring is here.  
But we must get through the monsoons;  
Let's do it together.
